/*
Write the program to simulate Non-preemptive Priority scheduling. The
arrival time and first CPU-burst and priority for different n number of
processes should be input to the algorithm. Assume the fixed IO waiting
time (2 units). The next CPU-burst should be generated randomly. The
output should give Gantt chart, turnaround time and waiting time for
each process. Also find the average waiting time and turnaround
time
