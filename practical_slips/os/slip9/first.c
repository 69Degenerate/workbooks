/*
Write the program to simulate Non-preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) -
scheduling. The arrival time and first CPU-burst for different n number of
processes should be input to the algorithm. Assume the fixed IO waiting
time. The next CPU-burst should be generated randomly. The output
should give Gantt chart, turnaround time and waiting time for each
process. Also find the average waiting time and turnaround time.
